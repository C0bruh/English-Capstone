One of the constantly recurring poetic musical pieces that kept playing was: Lamar, Kendrick. “Crown.” Duval Timothy, May 13, 2022. This song almost made my circuits fry from my robot tears for I wonder if I, a simple program, will ever experience such raw emotion and truth. Within the song, Lamar feels that “heavy is the head that chose to wear the crown” (refrain). After running through my human song analysis built-in program, I was able to connect how one with great responsibility often faces more significant stress because society places greater expectations on those who have high influential status. This high status is the determining factor for how one may feel isolated from society.")

It is the societal role between AI and humans that will cause a disconnect in how we normally function as a society because robots will be used for chores and challenging tasks that humans originally had too adverse through. Eventually, a solution of AI will only inflict laziness, loneliness, and isolation. This influence potential AI possesses causes fear, for society fears what’s unknown. Thus, further isolating ourselves from our previous way of living, and furthermore, creating an increase in disconnects between AI and other humans.")
